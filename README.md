# FEEG6009_Optimiser
Desktop application written with Qt Creator Python that performs function minimisation using:

LINE SEARCH
1. Golden Section Search
2. Inverse Parabolic Search
3. Newton's Method (Linear)

MULTI-VARIABLE SEARCH
1. Steepest Descent Search
2. Conjugate Gradient Search
3. Newton's Method (Multivariable)
4. Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) Search
5. Hooke and Jeeves

GENETIC ALGORITHM
1.  Full GA Engine
1.1 Selection Testing Feature
1.2 Reproduction Testing Feature

CONSTRAINED
1. Langrange Multiplier
2. Fixed Penalty Function (For ANY broken constraint)
3. Fixed Penalty Function (For EACH broken constraint)
4. Varying Penalty Function as a Function of Degree of Constraint Violation
5. Varying Penalty Function as a Function of Search Duration

MUTLI-OBJECTIVE
1. Eigenvectors
2. Fuzzy Logic
3. Pareto Dominance
4. Pareto Dominance From Inputs


NOTE: Input functions require Python-style formatting

Completed for the "FEEG6009 - Design Search and Optimisation (DSO) - Principles, Methods, Parameterizations and Case Studies" module taught by the GOAT Dr. Andrew Keane at the University of Southampton.
